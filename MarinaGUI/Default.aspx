            Welcome to Inland Marina located on the south shore Inland Lake, just a small commute from 
            major centers in the south west. <br /><br />
        
            Inland Marina was established in the 1967 shortly after 
            Inland Lake was created as a result ofthe Southwest dam. From its humble beginnings, it 
            has grown to be the largest marina on Inland Lake. Due to the warm climate that extends 
            year-round, Inland Lake has become apopular tourist destination in the south west. Boat 
            owners from California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah are attracted to the area. Inland Marina 
            has 90 slips ranging in size from 16 to 32 feet in length. Dock services include electrical 
            and fresh water.
